# Tetrix
Tetrix is a custom Tetris-style puzzle game that I’m building completely from scratch using Flutter and Dart.

## Game Rules:
The core gameplay includes:

- A 10×20 grid where blocks fall and stack

- Seven tetromino shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)

- Player actions: move left/right, rotate, soft drop, hard drop

- Line clearing when a row is fully filled

- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses

- Game ends when pieces reach the top of the board

- This section will expand as I finalize the full rule set.

## Prototype for the UI of the main game (generated with Google Stitch):
